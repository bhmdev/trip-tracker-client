**Development Process**

Version 1:

The MVP has a single user creating trips  that belong to them and can be edited by them alone.

After initial planning where I outlined how I wanted my app to function, I createed the desired forms and CRUD operations.

Trips for the submit actions were created and linked to the API calls.

Decided to make success/failure messages.

**Unsolved Issues & Future Goals**

- Better Styling 
- 3rd party APi would like to be implemented
- Search Bar
